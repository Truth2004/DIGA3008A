            <h2 class="p-name">The TikTok ban of 2024</h2>
            <p>
                by
                <a class="p-author h-card" href="../about-me/about-me.html">Nhlanzeko Mwandla</a> on
                <time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-06-3"> 13 June 2025</time>
            </p>
            <p>In today’s world, political tensions are no longer confined to political meetings and economic
                agreements. Instead, these tensions are seen through the control of online platforms. The 2024 proposal
                to ban TikTok in the US highlights how issues like national security, digital inequality and data
                control are connected in a manner that’s deeper than we think. With TikTok being as popular as it is
                while being owned by the Chinese company known as ByteDance, US leaders started to raise concerns about
                user privacy and how the platform might be used for misinformation, propaganda as well as economic
                competition. </p>
            <p>While these concerns seemingly focus on the safety of American users, they reflect a larger global issue
                like global inequality and technological domination. This essay argues that the TikTok ban is more than
                just a safety issue, but its part of a larger tug of war over who controls the internet and the flow of
                information and data. The ban shows how powerful countries use their influence in order to stay on top,
                often with no regard for others techno-colonialism (Verdi, 2020), internet geographies (Graham, 2014),
                digital divides (Lutz, 2019; Ragnedda and Ruiu, 2017), and platform power (Greenstein et al., 2018),
                this essay will look at the ban as a case study in how global power is reshaping the internet. </p>
            <p>In March 2024, the US House of Representatives passed a law demanding that ByteDance either sell its
                operations in the US or face a Ban (BBC,2024). The main issues that critics worried about are user data
                security, potential algorithmic control and economic competition. Lawmakers in the US feared that TikTok
                gathers a wide range of information on users and Chinese law might force the Chinese company into giving
                up that data. It’s believed that TikTok’s recommendation system can also deeply influence opinions and
                emotions of users which officials say could be used to promote disinformation or alter political views
                without users being fully aware. Another major issue they worry about is that TikTok is one of the few
                non-US platforms to gain major worldwide recognition, especially among younger people. Its success is
                seen as a direct challenge to American companies like Facebook, Google, YouTube and Instagram. </p>
            <p>While these can be seen as real concerns, they also happen within a context that reflects long standing
                American digital dominance as the US is home to global tech giants like Meta, Google and Amazon for
                example. Verdi (2020) describes it as techno-colonialism, a system where technological dependence and
                control create power imbalances that favour wealthy nations. When the US tries to push the Chinese
                company into selling its operations with the repercussions of banning them if they don’t, is them trying
                to reassert digital hegemony, reinforcing a digital hierarchy where non-Western companies are
                systematically excluded. So, while the ban may seem like the US rushing to protect the national security
                of its people, it also acts as them seeing an opportunity to gain even more control over global
                platforms, data flows and narratives. </p>
            <p>Before the internet really gained traction or it was still only imagined, it was often imagined as a
                place where everyone was free to interact. However, this idea seems more and more out of the question as
                the vision fades. Instead, we’re seeing a “splinternet”, a digital space where national rules,
                infrastructure and corporate interests seem to shape access. </p>
            <p>Greenstein and colleagues (2018) argue that the internet isn’t a neutral space, that it’s shaped by rules
                that might not favour everyone, economics and physical infrastructure. Countries are able to and do in
                fact act on the ability to control what their people see and use. A great example of this is Chinas
                Great Firewall blocking US platforms like Google and Facebook from being used in their country. Now the
                US is mirroring this tactic by turning around and banning TikTok in theirs. </p>
            <p>This kind of fragmentation isn’t limited to the US and China. India banned TikTok in 2020 due to similar
                concerns about data being misused. The European Union continues to craft stricter and stricter rules to
                attempt to control the growth of foreign platforms. The higher each country builds its digital walls,
                the internet gets increasingly segmented, notably between the Global North and the South. </p>
            <p>This is a massive problem for users in less wealthy countries as they often depend on global platforms
                for a few things such as entertainment, communication, more importantly business, education and social
                connections. A splinternet risks leaving them with even less opportunities, diminished freedom and less
                chance for innovation further reinforcing a digital version of global inequality. The digital divide
                becomes more than just about access; it’s about who controls the flow of knowledge and gets excluded
                from it. </p>
            <p>However, the real people affected by this ban include the content creators, moderators and small
                businesses who depend on TikTok to make a living. The platform supports a wide array ecosystem of
                influencers, people looking to get hired and performers as well as advertising teams. Such creators make
                most of the income through their sponsorships, partnerships and livestream sales. The platform relies
                heavily on global labour to keep the service afloat. When a platform that offers all these opportunities
                suddenly disappear from a country, it causes a bit of a shift across the three levels of inequality as
                highlighted by Ragnedda and Ruiu (2017): access divide - the ban restricts user access to a major
                platform, skill divide – creators are forced to adapt to new algorithms and interface systems, and
                outcome divide – marginalized creators suffer the most, with already fewer resources to push off from.
                So, all in all, the ban increases inequality, not only between countries but within them as well. </p>
            <p>The US says that TikTok violates user privacy however, it’s been a known thing that companies like Google
                and Facebook have been collecting user data for years, often without user consent, especially in less
                wealthy nations. These American tech giants benefit from users’ data without sharing much benefit in
                return. Graham (2014) describes this phenomenon as “data shadows”, the invisible trail of user data that
                powers digital services, mostly controlled by firms based in wealthier countries. However, most data
                shadows are often made in poorer regions that don’t benefit from them. </p>
            <p>When TikTok gets targeted by the US for “data issues”, it serves as a geopolitical performance of ethical
                governance. The adoption of strict cyber security laws against foreign countries enhances political
                standing and economic advantage but ignores how American companies operate around the world with even
                fewer barriers. This duality highlights how the US isn’t neutral; it defends its digital power by
                accusing other of ill intent even while they’re guilty or the same or worse practices. Policies are
                framed as protecting their people when they have ulterior motives of reinforcing digital inequality.
            </p>
            <p>The TikTok ban brings together several threads of digital colonialism. First, it demonstrates how digital
                infrastructures are used as tools of soft power and national influence. Comparable to how colonial
                empires would take control of trade routes, modern powers strive for control over apps and algorithmic
                visibility (Verdi, 2020). Second, the ban shows how platform dependency exposes digital labourers and
                user to unforeseen geopolitical events. Unlike traditional jobs with security, digital platforms can
                disappear as quick as they came due to factors politics. Finally, the event reinforces the idea that
                control over data and narrative production is a core element of statecraft. The ban wasn’t just about
                the US worrying for their people, it was about the gaining cultural influence and being at the top of
                the hierarchy in a world increasingly divided by digital walls. </p>
            <p>The US ban on TikTok stands at a crossroad for a fight for global power and economic rivalry with
                national security being the facade put up to avoid public backlash. It shows how close digital platforms
                really are with matters like state interest, corporate influence and inequality. The ban also exposes
                the fragility of creator economies and the uneven distribution of digital power globally. By looking at
                everything through the lens of techno-colonialism, splinternet and digital labour, we start to see how
                the internet is not a neutral or fair space. It is shaped by power, money and global politics. As
                countries continue to fight over dominance of the digital world, a question we should ask ourselves is
                “what happens to users in the Global South where people may still face barriers to access, freedom and
                fair representation online?”. The TikTok ban shows us that in future, countries won’t be fighting over
                land but fighting over the control of screens. </p>
