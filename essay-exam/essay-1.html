                <a class="p-author h-card" href="../about-me/about-me.html">Nhlanzeko Mwandla</a> on

            </p>
            <p>In today’s world, digitalization has made it so that online digital news providers now play
                an important role and have a major impact in influencing how people interpret and
                extrapolate information. In my essay, I’ll be using one of South Africa’s leading digital
                news providers, News24, as a case study in me examining how design choices
                influence user behaviour, as well as information accessibility. This essay will be
                exploring how News24’s user interface (UI), user experience (UX) and approach to
                ethical interaction affect the way people interact with their website, as well as its
                effectiveness in keeping people updated on the latest news. </p>

            <p>My analysis is going to focus on three main areas. How the website looks and how it is structured (user
                interface), how easy it is to navigate and overall, how smooth it feels
                (user experience), and the ethical issues that may arise when a website’s design
                choices focus more on its engagement than the well being of those making use of the
                website for the services it provides. I’ll be making use of design experts like Don
                Norman, known as the father of user experience, who pioneered user and human
                centred design and coined the term “user experience”. Steve Krug, the author of “Don’t
                Make Me Think”, a reading that focuses on making websites simple and intuitive. Lastly,
                Jakob Nielsen and Kara Pernice, authors of “Eye tracking Web Usability”, which studied
                how users visually interact with websites. </p>

            <p>News24 has established itself as the country's leading digital news destination amusing
                over a million concurrent monthly users. However, it offers content that is free while
                some is behind a pay wall. This creates a natural conflict between providing quality
                journalism as a news provider and making as much profit as they can as a business. </p>

            <p>I chose to use News24 as a case study for a few reasons. The first one being the sheer
                amount of people who use it. Its design alone impacts how a large audience, country
                wide, reads the news. Second, with it being one of the leading news sites in South
                Africa, it is often used as an example of what a good news website is by other news
                providers. Third, News24 tries to find a balance between making money while keeping
                those who use the site happy. This is something shared globally by digital news
                providers. </p>

            <p>News24’s interface follows a conventional digital news design where there’s a headline
                driven layout with an easy to see navigation section that features categorization. This
                platform makes use of a responsive grid layout that changes accordingly to fit the
                screen size of a wide variety of devices. This is a smart design choice because a
                majority of people who visit the site use a mobile device as another means of reading up on news if its
                not through a television or a computer. The platform makes use of Mundo
                Sans as its primary font, while its secondary font is Arial. This choice is due to there
                being a focus on readability and accessibility. This Typography ensures readability on
                smaller screen or users with a 1024x768 resolution. This is paired with a colour contrast
                that helps to strategically guide the user’s attention (white background and large dark
                text). This aligns with Don Normans principles of perceived affordances where design
                elements intuitively communicate their functionality to the viewer. </p>

            <p>However, a major issue that can be seen is how the user interface seems to clutter,
                ruining the effectiveness of the website’s overall readability. This is due to advertising
                banner ads, sponsored banners and pop ups creating what’s known as “visual noise”
                ruining the reading experience. This goes against Steve Krugs fundamental usability
                principle of minimizing cognitive load in “Don’t Make Me Think”. The website makes use
                of thumbnail images, while being helpful for faster browsing, further adds to the
                impression of there being visual noise as other visual elements like pop up ads and
                sponsor banners are already drawing the viewers’ attention away from the actual
                content. These elements are almost having a tug of war for the viewers attention. </p>

            <p>Particularly the problem lies in the platforms management of white space. Research in
                visual perception, like the Gestalt theory, emphasizes that the whole of anything is
                greater than its parts, suggests that a good amount of white space helps with readability
                and processing information easier, however, News24 frequently sacrifices this for
                additional content or advertising. When simply being more careful with where they put
                their content and reducing the number of ads could help make the website look better
                without entirely ruining its ability to make money. </p>

            <p>News24 offers a user experience that’s both positive and negative. On one hand, the
                platform offers an intuitive navigation at the top of the webpage that’s got clearly
                labelled categories like politics, sports, business and so on, and a functional search
                bar. These elements align with Jakob Nielsons idea of what a good design is concerning
                system visibility and giving users control. The platform is efficient at pushing out the
                latest news, but at times the alerts can feel too pushy. </p>

            <p>The mobile experience differs from that of the computer experience. While the websites
                design is responsive based on the device you’re using, performance issues such as
                slow loading times and ads being in even worse pop-up positions than its pc
                counterpart, ruins the overall experience. Given that mobile devices account for the
                majority of the digital news consumers, these issues can be considered a major flaw in
                the website’s user experience. The use of auto playing videos can improve engagement
                in users, however, a majority of people may feel that it is unnecessary as it consumes
                mobile data, resulting in frustration due to how expensive mobile data is in South Africa. </p>

            <p>The platforms endless scroll feature is common amongst other digital news providers.
                While it keeps users engaged with the platform for longer, it doesn’t help the user
                experience as much as it can overwhelm users and make it harder for them to
                remember content. Without clear breaks in between each section, the constant
                scrolling can make it harder for users to take in and understand the websites content. </p>

            <p>The most worrying part about News24s design is seen in its ethical side. The platform
                employs design tricks that helps them boost engagement but raise significant ethical
                concerns. An example of this is the use of clickbait headlines, which often makes
                stories seem more exciting than they are or misrepresents story content. While this
                practise can guarantee more clicks, it can damage the trust users have for the platform
                long term. </p>

            <p>Another ethical trick they employ is the implementation of paywalls. News24 tends to
                allow users to read a small amount of an article before presenting them with a
                subscription prompt. Although it follows business norms, the site could be more
                upfront about which content requires payments to read. Another issue is when ads are
                portrayed in a manner that gives users the idea that they are apart of the editorial
                content. This misleads users about what they are engaging with as it blurs the line
                between ads and news, further reducing trust. </p>

            <p>These patterns fall under the category of “dark patterns”. Dark patterns are design
                features that encourage users to perform specific actions, however, unlike good UX,
                these actions benefit the company more than the user as they use deception as a tool.
                News24s use of emotionally charged headlines and autoplay content exemplifies this
                trend as they prioritize engagement over sharing news in a more responsible manner. </p>

            <p>Learning about web design has made me more aware of issues in how News24 is built.
                Issues like inconsistent heading hierarchies and poorly labelled interactive elements
                make the platform harder to use and navigate, especially for people with accessibility
                needs. The sites use of external scripts for advertising and tracking noticeably impacts
                its performance, goes against the core principles of efficient web development. These
                issues show why ethical design matters. How videos or images load and even how
                elements are organized can seriously affect the user experience, even if those effects
                aren’t obvious at first. </p>

            <p>Things that I think News24 could improve on is implementing stricter rules for ad
                placement and reducing the sheer number of pop ups, particularly on mobile devices. I
                believe that prioritizing loading speed on mobile devices through better asset
                management could go a long way because as stated before, a majority of the platform’s
                consumers are using mobile devices. They can also be more upfront about what
                content is behind a paywall. Lastly, they should be more upfront about what users can expect in content
                without resorting to using dark patterns like clickbait. This would
                make them more reliable and helps to build trust among users. </p>

            <p>News24s design has its strengths and weaknesses with a few areas needing
                improvement. While its layout and structure enable users to do what they need, too
                many ads, slow performance and questionable design choices hurt the overall
                experience of the platform. The platform has a clear conflict between making money
                and giving users a smooth and trustworthy experience. </p>

            <p>My analysis suggests that’s News24 could maintain its ability to make money while still
                improving its usability through more thoughtful design implementations. The bigger
                takeaway for digital news providers is that putting its users first isn’t just morally
                correct, but it’s also a sustainable business strategy. Ensuring that a platform isn’t just
                pushing for engagement and actually helps users, fostering a community of trust
                resulting in users coming back. </p>

            <p>As time goes on, News24 and other platforms alike must make a decision. Will they
                continue to prioritize getting clicks, or invest in interfaces that respect the users time,
                attention and choices. While the second option might be harder at first, it ensures long
                term success in the competitive industry of digital news. </p>
