            <p>
                by
                <a class="p-author h-card" href="../about-me/about-me.html">Nhlanzeko Mwandla</a> on
                <time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-06-13"> 13 June 2025</time>
            </p>
            <p>From the very start, it’s been my goal to create a website where I showcase my skills as a web developer,
                game designer and artist with a clean minimalistic aesthetic. However, the deeper I got into making this
                website, the more I started to understand just how important it was to be intentional with my designs
                and ideas. During the process of making my website, I tried to put a strong emphasis on making it as
                clear and as user friendly as possible. I made sure whenever I added anything, it was with impactful
                intentionality and that it still felt intuitive and responsive. Because of this, the way I added UI and
                UX had a major impact on my code and how its features are structured and implemented. I attempted to
                make organized code that would easily be scalable for future growth.</p>

            <p>My folder structure makes use of an organized hierarchical information structure where each major section
                has its own corresponding HTML file in the root directory, eg, Home, Game Dev, Gallery… This helps to
                keep my sites navigation clear and intuitive. Each of these HTML files are reminiscent of how users will
                navigate your site, with each page/HTML file being its own destination. I’ve made sure to separate
                styles in a dedicated css folder, JavaScript in a js folder, and images go into the images folder. I’ve
                made sure that there’s little to no inline styling and made my structure organized so its easier to
                maintain and expand on a later date. I’ve made sure that HTML is strictly used for content and
                structure, CSS managers the presentation while the JS handles the interactivity of my site. I make use
                of consistent readable naming conventions that enable me to easily add more content into existing
                layouts without needing to restructure anything. Overall, my folder structure supports both user and
                developer experience as it is easy to navigate on both sides due to it being clean and logical.</p>

            <p>Throughout my site, I make use of semantic HTML tags like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;,
                &lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; to give browsers and screen readers context on the structure and
                meaning of each section. I mainly use these elements to communicate how content is grouped to the user.
                Each blog page with weekly entries is treated as a self-contained article and makes use of the
                &lt;article&gt; tag, while the page navigations are wrapped in a &lt;nav&gt; tag to help communicate to
                users and screen readers that it’s for navigating between pages. The heading tag, eg, &lt;h1&gt;, is
                used throughout my website to create visual hierarchy and topic nesting which benefits both SEO and
                screen readers. Interface elements like buttons and other interactive components are all expressed
                through native HTML elements like &lt;button&gt; which ensures that they’re keyboard accessible by
                default and easily understood by assistive technologies. Using semantic elements helps to separate
                presentation from meaning. I used the &lt;div&gt; class sparingly if there was something else I could’ve
                used instead that gave more information to the user. Overall, semantic markup has played a massive role
                in improving the UX and accessibility of my website while also helping to keep my code more readable.
            </p>

            <p>All pages for the most part have essential metadata such as their responsive viewport settings, page
                titles and a short description of what that page is for. As basic as it is, it goes a long way in
                improving accessibility. This makes it easier for search engines and browsers to interpret my content
                better.</p>

            <p>I’ve used external CSS stylesheets to manage all visual stylings across my whole website. I made sure to
                avoid inline styling which helps to keep the HTML clean and consistent across all pages. These
                stylesheets ensure that the website is easier to maintain as well as making any future updates easier as
                the code for the visuals are focused in specific external css files. I tried to make my css as
                consistent as I could by making use of recurring class names with the correct naming conventions so I
                could use them on multiple pages without having to have more stylesheets than needed. Elements like the
                navigation, my gallery and text sections respond to different platform screen sizes which improves
                accessibility and the overall user experience. My css helps to support clean code as well as helping in
                visual consistency and creating a user-friendly interface.</p>

            <p>I make use of Javascript in my website for interactivity purposes by targeting and manipulating DOM
                elements based on the actions a user performs. The main key implementations I make use of include a back
                to top button that appears after scrolling a certain number of pixels from the top and uses
                window.scrollTo() for smooth upward movement, A typing animation on my About page that loops through the
                phrase “Design. Code.Create.Repeat”, using textContent updates and delays =, creating a subtle branded
                animation. A toggleable side navigation menu using classList.toggle(), which improves mobile UX and
                keeps navigation accessible without taking up space. On my gallery page, clicking an image triggers a
                lightbox effect and the full image appears in an overlay using style.display=’flex’, and clicking the
                overlay closes it again, improving engagement without breaking the browsing flow. The blog navigation
                buttons dynamically determine their behaviour based on the current page position in a JavaScript array.
                This allows for streamlined navigation across the weekly blogs section improving flow. In all these
                cases, I used DOM methods like getElementById, querySelectorAll, addEventListner, and properties like
                style, src and textContent to update elements based on user interaction. All scripts are kept in
                externel js files and are linked in the html using &lt;script src=””&gt;, keeping the logic clean and
                separate from content and styling.</p>

            <p>Overall, the sites design and technical structure work together to create what I’d deem as a balanced and
                thoughtful user experience. My implementation reflects a growing understanding of how UI and UX
                decisions can and should drive how a site is built under the hood. Although I still have a long way to
                go and improving on how I do things, this project helped me gain a bit of confidence in learning better
                practices of writing clean code, while also prioritizing usability, accessibility and responsiveness. I
                look forward to any opportunities that will allow me to grow and further my craft in future and I look
                forward to being an even better web developer by continuing to explore in my studies.</p>
