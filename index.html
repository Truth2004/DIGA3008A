            <h2>Where Creativity Meets Impact.</h2>
            <p>
                I design and build experiences that make people feel something, whether it's joy, challenge, curiosity,
                or clarity. My goal is to improve how users interact with games and digital products by focusing on what
                truly matters to them. By creating experiences that are both engaging and intuitive, I help create real
                value for players, users, and businesses alike.

                <h3>Craft</h3>
                <p>
                    As an artist, game designer and web developer, I bridge creative vision and technical execution.
                    From prototyping mechanics to coding responsive interfaces, I use design and development tools to
                    communicate ideas clearly and bring concepts to life. Collaboration is at the heart of my process. I
                    thrive in cross-functional teams and believe the best outcomes come from shared understanding and
                    communication.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="value-block">
                <h3>Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    Design is a discovery process. Whether I’m balancing gameplay systems or optimizing user journeys, I
                    see design as a way to learn what users need and shape how they experience the world. The more we
                    understand our audience, the better we can align creative intent with business goals and build
                    products that people love to use or play.

            <div class="value-block">
                <h3>Leadership</h3>
                <p>
                    Games and websites are built by teams, not individuals. I aim to lead by creating space for others
                    to contribute, learn, and grow. I believe in aligning around a common vision, building trust across
                    disciplines, and fostering a creative environment where experimentation is encouraged and feedback
                    is valued.
