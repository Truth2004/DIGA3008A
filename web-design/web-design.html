            <h2>Design inspiration</h2>
            <p>I’ve taken inspiration from Aaminah Habibs website as it stood out to me. She makes use
                of a
                minimalistic modern design that prioritizes her content, which also aligns with the goal
                I
                set out for myself. Her colour pallet leans to the neutral end and does amazingly in
                keeping
                her website appearing balanced. There is consistency throughout her site which I aim to
                replicate in my own way. This is seen in the page layouts, colour and nav bar
                positioning.
                She makes use of a sticky nav bar on each page which really stood out to me as it makes
                navigating her website an absolute breeze. I’m considering employing this method in a
                future
                iteration to increase my user-friendly experience as I think it would make a wonderful
                addition. It keeps the design unified while making sure users always have access to
                important sections of the website.</p>

            <h2>Style Guide</h2>
            <p>Statement: My website will showcase a minimalistic aesthetic prioritizing user friendliness,
                in highlighting my skills in interactive media and Game design.</p>

            <h3>Visual aesthetic</h3>
            <p>My websites aesthetic is leaning towards being minimalistic and modern. This ensures a sleek
                design while also making sure that it’s not overwhelming for the viewer. My design focuses
                on displaying my Interactive media and game design content so it shouldn’t be fighting for
                the attention of the person viewing the website, drawing it away from the actual work.
                Having a minimalistic design also ensures that viewers can navigate their way through each
                page without feeling lost.</p>

            <h3>Colour scheme</h3>

            <p>Black and white ensures readability and clarity to viewers. This colour matchup works well
                with a minimalistic interface because simplicity and functionality are prioritized. In
                colour theory we say that they are achromatic, meaning they lack hue and saturation. This
                ensures that my website looks balanced. It removes distractions while making the content and
                layout of the site stand out.</p>

            <h3>Layout</h3>

            <p>The layout of the website will focus on the prioritization of content, so it’ll make use of
                a grid structure ensuring a well organized and visually balanced look. Having generous
                amounts of black and white space will improve the readability and focus of the viewer while
                reducing clutter. Each page is going to have a nav bar at the top and a button on either the
                bottom left or right that lets them skip back to the top without having to scroll.</p>

            <p>My homepage is going to give a short introduction welcoming users to my site and stating who
                I am, with a little picture just below the Navigation bar, at the centre of the page. This
                helps to make the users experience feel a bit more personal. The user will then be able to
                scroll down and see a “featured projects” section of project cards with thumbnails and a
                short description on them giving them a bit of an idea of what they are looking at.</p>

            <p>The gallery page is going to showcase any art I’ve worked on. These works will be displayed
                using a hierarchical grid structure to keep the page looking organized. Clicking on an image
                will make it upsize so users can take a closer look. The grid itself will be made of squares
                and rectangles placed next to each other in a random manner. This is to allow the eye to
                wonder around the page as they try look for balance.</p>

            <p>My blogs page will make use of the same thumbnail cards as the featured projects section on
                my homepage, Each card will have a snippet of what you can read, while clicking on “read
                more” will bring up the contents. These cards will also have visuals, so viewers get quick
                insight encouraging them to read up further. </p>

            <p></p>The Game dev page will make use of the same structure as the blogs page, with thumbnail
            cards. <br>

            <h3>Interface Element Representations</h3>

            <h4>Navigation Bar</h4>

            <p>The use of this element on each page allows the user to easily move back and forth between
                the pages while also being notified what page they’re on. The nav bar fitting the
                minimalistic theme also aids in a user-friendly interface.</p>

            <h4>Buttons</h4>

            <p>Buttons enable the user to interact with the websites interface. They are just going to be
                clickable text with a potential animation put in or hover state to show that you’re over it
                with your mouse cursor.</p>
