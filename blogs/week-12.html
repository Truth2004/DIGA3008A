            <h2 class="p-name">Decolonial coding</h2>

            <p>Recently I’ve been thinking about how my coding choices limit or support people with access to my
                website. From a decolonial perspective, I’ve come to realise that I need to be more conscious of making
                sure my site works for people with slower internet, older devices, and that my layout is as intuitive as
                it can possibly be to factor in people who have no technical background. This means making sure I use
                readable fonts, simple to understand navigation, and I don’t go crazy when it comes to what I decide to
                use JavaScript for. </p>
            <p>In this moment in time I'm still exploring my options in terms of what I can do to make my website
                better. I haven't gotten a strong understanding of what elements exactly would be more efficient and
                reliable being JavaScript instead of just HTML and CSS. It feels like I've only just started to get a
                grasp on these basics, however, I'm going to have to move out of my comfort zone because the
                implementation of JavaScript into my website is the next step to furthering my portfolio. </p>
            <p>Although I haven't started actually implementing JavaScript, I have an idea of what I'll use it for:</p>

            <p>I hope to implement JavaScript by using show/hide sections for my blog posts. Adding a form validation
                in my about for getting in touch with me. This will check if required fields are filled as well as
                validate emails or passwords before submitting. Adding animations and page transitions to help make my
                website feel visually smoother. This includes having a smooth scrolling to sections feature. I’ll also
                make use of scroll-based animations that fade in or slide elements into view as users scroll. Loading
                content without refreshing the page. Helping with the implementation of tabs which lets people see
                content without having to leave the page.
            </p>
            <p>These features will help keep my design clean and make the site easier to use, without overwhelming
                people with too much content at once, I can guide them through my site in a more natural way. It also
                includes accessibility as a core part of my design, further boosting user experience. </p>
