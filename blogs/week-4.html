            <h3>Interaction Design Process</h3>

            <p>My site is specifically to showcase my works to potential employers, collaborators and
                recruiters who want to see my digital art projects. These projects include Game Designs,
                game developments and art. My site needs to clearly/easily show my projects in a way that
                gives viewers an idea of my skill and experience. It needs to have easy navigation. The
                customization of the website should also have a unique aesthetic that showcases my
                personality a bit, so it feels a bit more personal when viewers are going through my
                website.</p>

            <p>I’m going to try work on at least a single interactive element a week (like hover effects or
                expandable thumbnail sections). As well as taking into consideration what my website will
                look like on different platforms. Besides working on the actual content of the website, I’ll
                just be continuing to build it up bit by bit.</p>

            <h3>Website 1 Reflection</h3>

            <h4>Struggles:</h4>

            <p>Main thing I’m trying to focus on is making sure my website looks good and is a good
                representation of myself. Having a balance of visuals to text is currently what I’m working
                on first because I feel it would be easier to make a decent looking website for my first
                iterations over a good one. However, I don’t want to make it too text heavy, but that also
                risks making it seem empty.</p>

            <h4>Proud of:</h4>

            <p>I’m proud of my idea of incorporating my game dev into the actual design of the website.
                Although it won’t be easy, I’m looking forward to my process of putting everything together.
                I’m also really proud of my progress so far in terms of understanding how to code a website.
                Its still early but I’m confident it’s only going to get better from here.</p>

            <h4>Going Forward:</h4>

            <p>Going forward I’d like to focus more on my actual design process and making it more
                structured. Right no it feels like I’m doing everything in bits and pieces which doesn’t
                feel pleasant for workflow on my end.</p>

            <p>I’m going to work a bit more on adding the base of my website and make it as consistent as
                possible throughout all the pages.</p>

            <p>Lastly, I’m going to do more research on interactive elements to help make my website feel
                livelier.</p>
