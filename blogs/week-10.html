            <h2 class="p-name">Internet Access is a Fundamental Right- Spyros Kasapis</h2>

            <p>In Spyros Kasapis article, Internet Access is a Fundamental Right, he argues that internet access
                should be treated like a necessity, even going as far as calling it a human right, grouping it with
                things like food, education and healthcare. Particularly highlighting the social imbalance and
                divide it caused during the COVID-19 pandemic. The article references Salvador Allendes idea of how
                happiness is dependant on basic needs being met. He then follows up by arguing that in today’s
                digital world, internet access is just as important.</p>
            <p>Kasapis references a 2020 decision by the Indian Supreme Court that recognized internet access as a
                constitutional right under Article 19 (freedom of expression). He uses this to show how as time goes
                by, more and more countries are going to slowly start viewing internet access as being important,
                going as far as making implementing it into their laws. He emphasizes how the pandemic forced many
                people to rely heavily on the internet to continue working remotely, online schooling, shop or just
                to communicate with other people. However, this led to people who didn’t have access to the internet
                being disadvantaged as they were left out of important parts of life, making existing inequalities
                even worse. .</p>
            <p>In this article, Kasapis presents two ideas: internet access itself being a human right, or if it
                serves as a tool for people to exercise their rights, for example, freedom of speech and so on.
                While He recognizes this debate, he argues that based on the issues that arise from not having
                internet, especially in places like school or work, means that it should be treated as an essential.
            </p>
            <p>Kasapis ends the article by asking two major questions about the future. Firstly, should governments
                make sure that everyone has access to the internet? Secondly, who exactly should oversee running the
                internet, and what rules should be followed. He believes that the internet should be managed in a
                way that ensures fairness among its users, with a strong focus on protecting human rights. </p>
            <p>Kasapis aim in this article is to promote the view that internet access should be available to
                everyone globally, and that it helps ensure that human rights are maintained even in a digital
                society. His methodology is argumentative, and he draws on observations made, such as the COVID-19
                pandemic. The Indian Supreme Court ruling and philosophical reflections (Allende). The results are
                to show that political actions need to be taken to recognize access to the internet as a human right
                and create rules for the fair use of it. </p>
            <p>He makes a strong argument that was further backed by the COVID-19 pandemic, where digital
                inequalities were made very evident. However, the length of the content of the article makes it
                appear as though it lacks depth. He mentions how people like Jeff Bezos got richer while many others
                were disadvantaged from the lack of access to the internet, however he doesn’t explore systemic
                economic structures or suggest specific policies that can be put in place to help fix this issue.
            </p>
            <p>Kasapis mostly shows the internet as a neutral and positive tool. Critics like Evgeny Morozov, in The
                Net Delusion (2011) however, argue that the internet can be used to promote freedom as well as
                having control and surveillance. This basically means that simply providing access isn’t enough, you
                also must factor in how free, open and fair the access is. The exploration of these factors would be
                greatly beneficial as it could remove the assumption that the internet is always a force for good.
            </p>
            <p>While Kasapis briefly mentions internet governance, he doesn’t fully explore the different ways it
                can be managed. Scholars like Tim Wu (The Master Switch, 2010) argues that monopolies in the tech
                industry pose a serious threat to democracy. The use of this perspective could help deepen the
                discussion around how digital spaces should be structured and managed. </p>
            <p>Future research could look at how exactly the access to the internet can be made available to
                everyone while still being affordable, including those in disadvantaged communities. It could also
                explore the different ways the internet can be managed. Another thing that could be investigated is
                also the potential dangers of giving everyone access to the internet. These dangers include things
                like the spread of misinformation, scams or online surveillance. Researchers should also investigate
                exploring more about how not having access to the internet really impacted people’s education and
                work life in the long run. </p>
            <p>Kasapis article is a clear and convincing starting point for the idea that access to the internet
                should be considered a human right. Ideas from philosophy and politics are brought together and used
                an argument to further back his argument. However, it doesn’t tackle issues like who exactly should
                foresee the management of the internet, how economical systems like money and power can shape this
                access, as well as how technology can both be helpful and harmful. </p>
