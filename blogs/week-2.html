            <p>

                <a class="p-author h-card" href="../about/about.html">Nhlanzeko Mwandla</a> on

            </p>
            <p>In terms of the internet of today, Moulthrop’s warnings regarding corporate control has grown even more
                evident.
                Major tech companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, and X control the internet, influencing the ways in
                which
                information is retrieved and utilized. Rather than being the decentralized and democratic environment
                envisioned
                by early internet pioneers, the web has turned into a highly centralized platform, with algorithms
                dictating
                user visibility, much like how early hypertext got incorporated into established corporate media
                frameworks.
                Platforms currently emphasize profit over free exploration, with the monetization of user data serving
                as a
                significant motivator. Moulthrop’s concern about hypertext devolving into a standardized, corporate
                dominated
                medium has arguably materialized.</p>



            <p>However, its not all bad. Today’s internet still lives up to Moulthrop’s expectations when it comes to
                his
                ideas
                of hypertext enhancing pattern recognition and connectivity. Websites like Reddit allow users to throw
                ideas
                amongst themselves and help each other be more knowledgeable. At times this causes knowledge overload as
                too
                much knowledge may be shared and not enough is digested. This leads me to also include how Moulthrop’s
                observation that hypertext challenges traditional literacy is even more relevant now with the dominance
                of
                short
                form video content such as Tiktok or reels. Although allowing the flow of information to be greater, it
                reduces
                it to being comparable to almost a fraction of a second in the grand scheme of things. This makes it
                harder
                for
                people to really engage with such content. Although it may seem as though digital literacy is
                decreasing,
                text
                heavy content such as online books and choice games still align with Moulthrop’s idea of a digital
                typographic
                culture reemerging.</p>



            <p>While the internet has amplified hypertext’s ability to connect users, it has been turned into a tool for
                the
                capitalist system where its used for profit rather than for a cultural revolution</p>
