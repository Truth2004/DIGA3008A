            <h2 class="p-name">Launching Into The Web</h2>

            <p class="p-summary"> My experience of setting up GitHub and publishing to pages was pretty nerve racking.
                To me
                telling myself it
                was
                going to be easy vs how I had an issue that was easily fixed by me simply making a letter lowercase
                instead
                of
                uppercase, it reminded me just how finicky the course is. I guess I needed the reminder as I may have
                been
                getting complacent.</p>
            <div class="e-content">
                <p>A reading that stuck out to me was “Library of Babel” by Borges. It envisions a library with all the
                    worlds
                    knowledge, going as far as there apparently being a book just for this in the labyrinth known as the
                    Library
                    of
                    Babel. It stuck out to me because it highlighted how there’s going to be a point where there’s so
                    much
                    knowledge
                    that we won’t know what to do with. Relating to today’s internet, we have so many things coming in
                    daily
                    that we
                    can’t even tell apart what’s true and what’s not. What’s considered old knowledge and what’s
                    updated. It
                    speaks
                    of a dystopia of a world of interconnected text and a never-ending stream of information. This is
                    something
                    that’s prominent of today’s time. However, it does have its plus sides. We hold devices that allow
                    us to
                    look up
                    a wide array of knowledge with just our finger tips. Funny enough, the imagined Library of Babel
                    sits in our
                    pockets. Knowledge is sorted and categorized for us to sift through.</p>

                <p>An interesting thing I found on the history of the web is how initially, it was designed for
                    scientists to
                    share
                    information easily across institutions as a tool for high energy physics. I found it interesting
                    because
                    back
                    then it was something unheard of and advanced. However, by today’s standards, it’s the norm as much
                    as it is
                    seeing a child operating such as system. I also found it interesting how long before the web was
                    even
                    created,
                    people who didn't have access to it or even know of its future creation were already making their
                    own
                    version of
                    it (Library of Babel).</p>

                <p>My goals for the end of this course are to have grasped what has been taught to me and somewhat be
                    efficient
                    enough to explain why I do what I do. Getting a hang of the basics is crucial to the future years to
                    come as
                    it
                    steers my life in the direction, I have planned for myself. My goals are mainly to work hard and do
                    my
                    upmost
                    best to catch onto the course work as best as I can.</p>
