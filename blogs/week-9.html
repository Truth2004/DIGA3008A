                <h2>The Need for Global Internet Connectivity</h2>
                <p>In The Need for Global Internet Connectivity, Claire Daniolu argues that having access to internet is
                    no longer considered a luxury but a necessity. She shows how having access to the internet helps
                    different communities connect with the rest of the world, opens doors for better healthcare,
                    education and helps local businesses grow. She also mentions how sadly, not everyone has the same
                    accessibility to it. Poorer areas are disadvantaged in this sense. Claire Daniolu uses the term
                    “digital divide” to define the difference between people who have quick and easy access to the
                    internet and those who don’t. The Covid-19 pandemic is used as an example for Claire to exercise
                    this idea as she mentions how many services and schools moved online. In countries like South Africa
                    however, due to the split in classes, some were lucky enough to continue learning remotely while
                    others weren’t as lucky. People in low income homes and poorer areas were left behind due to having
                    bad internet or no internet at all because of it being too costly. Claire Daniolu also talks about
                    the dangers of being online. These dangers include the spread of misinformation and the loss of
                    cultural identity. She makes a strong case that internet is an essential and needs to be distributed
                    in a fair manner as to not disadvantage others. On top of this, people must be fair in how they use
                    it, as to not misinform other with false information. </p>

                <h2>Internet Access is a Fundamental Right – Especially During a Pandemic</h2>
                <p>This article argues that internet access should be treated like a necessity, even going as far as
                    calling it a human right, grouping it with things like food, education and healthcare. In today’s
                    world however, it doesn’t come as a surprise as we move deeper and deeper into a digital world.
                    People not having access grants them a clear disadvantage and that’s what Spyro Kasapis talks about.
                    He talks about how it deepens the social and economic inequality of a country, talking about the
                    same thing Claire Daniolu talks about, a “digital divide”. He also uses the pandemic as an example
                    of just how important the internet is in keeping a society going. He calls for the government to
                    guarantee free and affordable internet for everyone to ensure that everyone has a fair chance at
                    life.</p>
