            <h2 class="p-name">What does an ethical internet look like</h2>
            <p>
                by
                <a class="p-author h-card" href="../about-me/about-me.html">Nhlanzeko Mwandla</a> on
                <time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-05-18"> 18 May 2025</time>
            </p>
            <p> In my opinion, an ethical internet is one where everyone is treated fairly, has equal access and is
                protected from harm. It’s a digital space where everyone’s privacy is respected, there is transparency
                in content with no misuse of information, everyone is given a voice with no discrimination and
                technology serves people, not corporations or authoritarian interests. </p>

            <p>Drawing from Spyro Kasapis’s article,” Internet Access is a Fundamental Right”, access to the internet is
                no longer an optional thing to be connected to, it is essential for education, healthcare, and economic
                survival. This was further backed by using the Covid 19 pandemic as a source of reference on how
                exclusion from the internet deepened the divide of inequality between the rich and the poor, as it
                locked out marginalized communities out of critical services. In order for the internet to be considered
                ethical, access to it must be treated as a basic right instead of just a luxury, grouping it in with
                things like food, electricity, education and access to healthcare. </p>

            <p>An ethical internet should also protect users’ data and privacy. Today’s internet thrives on surveillance
                where our data is harvested, sold and even weaponized without consent. The Web Foundation warns that
                unchecked corporate and government data collection destroys trust and autonomy. Users should always
                understand how their data is being used and should have a say in if whether they allow it or not.
                Informed consent should be the default and terms of services shouldn’t be hidden in a long list of
                documents with hard to read text that no one reads. </p>

            <p>True accessibility means accounting for everyone using it. An ethical internet must actively consider
                diverse needs such as designing it for people with disabilities, language barriers and cultural
                backgrounds. People mustn’t be forced to adapt to such designs, but designs must be made easier to use
                and feel intuitive for users. </p>

            <p>Kasapis poses a critical question, “Who governs the internet?”. In this moment in time, tech giants
                manage how we communicate, consume information and guides how we think about certain situations based on
                what they decided to show us or allow us to see. An ethical internet would ensure that this isn’t the
                case. Instead, it would be governed collectively, with rules shaped by the very people who use it. </p>

            <p>Building this future, however, requires more than just policies being put in place, it requires actions
                to be taken. We must reject the idea that exploitation is the inevitable cost of convenience and instead
                demand that internet access aligns with human rights. Ultimately an ethical internet isn’t just about
                better technology but its about building a digital community that is accessible, fair and accountable to
                all. </p>
