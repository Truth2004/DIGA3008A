            <h2 class="p-name">Designing for Inclusion</h2>
            <p>
                by
                <a class="p-author h-card" href="../about-me/about-me.html">Nhlanzeko Mwandla</a> on
                <time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-05-26"> 26 May 2025</time>
            </p>
            <p> When we create art or write code, we aren’t just being creative but we’re also making choices that
                reflect our values. These choices either support fairness or make inequality worse. As time goes by, art
                and technology start to mix in a more prevalent manner, this means that we have to be more mindful of
                how we use the two. In my blog I’m going to explain how I attempt to be both ethical and artistic in my
                code through representation, how accessible my coding practices are, and if whether it has fairness.
            </p>

            <p> Art is often used to tell stories. In today’s time, technology has also been included in the meaning
                making process and is used as a tool to tell stories. However, with this being the case, a group of
                people is often left out or misrepresented through this. Questions like “whose stories are we telling
                and how are we going to tell them?” need to be asked by creators aiming to be ethical in their work. The
                first step is doing our outmost best in avoiding stereotypes and instead including diversity in the
                voices that speak out in storytelling through both art and technology. Mimi Onuohas “Library of Missing
                Datasets “explores how missing data can make an entire community appear invisible or non-existent. Most
                digital tools are often based on western ideas and beliefs of design. Researchers like Ramon Amaro talk
                about “abolitionist computation”, which means building tools that fight injustice instead of repeating
                it. </p>

            <p> This same data however has been found to have biases. Joy Buolamwinis “Gender Shades” study showed that
                facial recognition doesn’t work as well on darker skin toned people, that’s because the data used is
                mostly from lighter skinned faces. When the code for this is hidden away from the public, it also makes
                it harder for people to call out these problems. Explaining your design choices can make your work more
                ethical. </p>

            <p> Accessibility in my opinion must be held above all. It’s a major issue if people are unable to even use
                your platform because of their disability or lack of access you provide. A good design is descrived as
                one that includes everyone. The use of things like alt text, captioning your videos and making sure your
                work is easy to use with a keyboard or its responsive on smaller screens and screen readers can go a
                long way in promoting ethical coding. </p>

            <p> These systems are only possible through the people that are brought in to create it. Giving credit where
                credit is due is important. If your work draws on other cultures or groups of people, acknowledging this
                shows respect as well as being responsible with your sources. </p>

            <p> How your code is written can also have an impact on the environment. Making sure that you write
                efficient code that isn’t too power hungry allows you to save energy. Studies show that a single
                generative prompt consumes 3Wh of power. This may not seem like much but consider how many of these
                happen in a day. </p>

            <p> When ethical practices are being mentioned, no ones expecting you to get everything right, just that you
                do more research into making your code as efficient as you can in the moment. By considering who its
                for, how its used and who benefits from it, we can make art and code support justice. </p>
