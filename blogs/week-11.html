            <h2 class="p-name">The Politics of Digital Access- Reflective reading</h2>

            <p>In͏͏ Robinson͏͏ et͏͏ al.͏͏ (2015),͏͏ the͏͏ gap in difference in level of͏͏ resources͏͏ across͏͏ the͏͏
                digital͏͏ divide͏͏ has͏͏ been͏͏ described as͏͏ an͏͏ advanced͏͏ form͏͏ of͏͏ social͏͏ stratification.͏͏
                Race,͏͏ socio-economical͏͏ status,͏͏ class,͏͏ gender͏͏ and͏͏ age͏͏ are͏͏ factors that͏͏ add͏͏ depth͏͏
                to͏͏ this͏͏ divide.͏͏ Their͏͏ work,͏͏ as͏͏ many͏͏ others͏͏ have͏͏ done,͏͏ spans͏͏ the͏͏ issue͏͏ of͏͏
                digital͏͏ divides͏͏ through͏͏ social͏͏ stratification,͏͏ however͏͏ whereas͏͏ others͏͏ refrained͏͏ from͏͏
                addressing͏͏ fractures͏͏ born͏͏ from͏͏ the͏͏ lack͏͏ of͏͏ corporate͏͏ and͏͏ political͏͏ opportunistic͏͏
                considerations,͏͏ Robinson͏͏ and͏͏ colleagues͏͏ decided͏͏ to͏͏ try͏͏ a͏͏ different͏͏ perspective of͏͏
                understanding͏͏ the͏͏ imbalance͏͏ where͏͏ individual͏͏ blame͏͏ gets͏͏ framed͏͏ as͏͏ systemic͏͏
                injustice.͏͏ Their͏͏ argument͏͏ seems͏͏ to͏͏ fall͏͏ to͏͏ over-simplification͏͏ of͏͏ the͏͏ dominant͏͏
                social͏͏ power͏͏ of͏͏ contemporary͏͏ corporatism. </p>
            <p>The article utilizes an intersectional framework demonstrating how social inequalities intersect with
                forms of digital inequality. For example, it emphasizes the point that women tend to underperform their
                male counterparts even when they are equally skilled (Hargittai & Shafer, 2006). Women, socially
                conditioned to cater to patriarchal norms, often lack confidence in their abilities, something worse
                when it comes to specialization domains like technology. </p>
            <p>The section on racial gaps shows us how digital exclusion tends to reflect real world inequalities. The
                author compares two different views, one that argues that the digital gap replicates already existing
                social hierarchies, while the other argues that digital tools can mitigate inequality by expanding
                social networks. </p>
            <p>Another valuable contribution is the life course perspective that shows how digital inequalities grow
                over time. The author mentions how kids from poorer areas often lack access to fast internet or any,
                greatly limiting their ability to learn digital literacy. This leads to things like poor performance at
                school, leading to less job opportunities for them, and even health gaps in the new future. While richer
                people get a massive advantage like easier access to healthcare services and better job opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>However, the article could delve deeper into how the mentioned inequalities are institutionalized. For
                example, public schools, especially those that aren’t on the privileged side, can’t afford digital tools
                to help students with digital literacy, while richer kids can afford their own digital tools and private
                tutors. This shows that digital inequality isn’t just about individual access but about systems failing
                certain marginalized communities of people. </p>
            <p>The article sometimes focuses a little too much on individual factors contributing to digital inequality.
                While it acknowledges structural factors, it mainly highlights skills, usage patterns, and
                self-perception. This could give the idea that digital exclusion is more of a personal problem rather
                than a systemic one, ignoring issues like corporate monopolies over internet infrastructure, biased
                algorithms, or unaffordable broadband in low-income areas. </p>
            <p>The author also sometimes acts like more digital access helps. They note that tech savvy workers earn
                more (DiMaggio and Bonikowski, 2008) or that eHealth improves care. But they ignore how digital tools
                can also enable abuse like exploitation such as health apps that commodify personal data. A sharper
                critique might ask something along the lines of: does digital inclusion really help marginalized groups,
                or just trap them in new forms of low wage and surveillance? </p>
            <p>The article briefly touches up on global gaps, noting that Africa, despite containing 14% of the world’s
                population, accounts for only 3% of internet users (Fuchs & Horak, 2008). This imbalance stems from
                neocolonial systems where rich countries and big companies dominate internet access, costs, and content.
                The authors could have dug deeper into how western tech companies profit from the south while offering
                locals with limited, often censored connections. </p>
            <p>They also miss resistance movements, like community run networks or open-source tools that battles
                corporate control. Including these perspectives would have provided more of a nuanced view of how
                marginalized groups are not victims of digital inequality, but they’re fighting back to reclaim
                technology. </p>
            <p>In this article, Robison et al. (2025) convincingly shows how digital inequality is a critical social
                issue, intersecting with and reinforcing existing forms of oppression. However, their analysis could be
                further improved on by directly confronting the economic and political systems causing these
                inequalities. Digital inequality isn’t just about technology, but its about that technology by fair for
                everyone who uses it. While the article does address this, real change requires looking at the root
                causes, not just their results. </p>
