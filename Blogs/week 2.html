    <p>In terms of the internet of today, Moulthrop’s warnings regarding corporate control has grown even more evident.
        Major tech companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, and X control the internet, influencing the ways in which
        information is retrieved and utilized. Rather than being the decentralized and democratic environment envisioned
        by early internet pioneers, the web has turned into a highly centralized platform, with algorithms dictating
        user visibility, much like how early hypertext got incorporated into established corporate media frameworks.
        Platforms currently emphasize profit over free exploration, with the monetization of user data serving as a
        significant motivator. Moulthrop’s concern about hypertext devolving into a standardized, corporate dominated
        medium has arguably materialized.</p>



    <p>However, its not all bad. Today’s internet still lives up to Moulthrop’s expectations when it comes to his ideas
        of hypertext enhancing pattern recognition and connectivity. Websites like Reddit allow users to throw ideas
        amongst themselves and help each other be more knowledgeable. At times this causes knowledge overload as too
        much knowledge may be shared and not enough is digested. This leads me to also include how Moulthrop’s
        observation that hypertext challenges traditional literacy is even more relevant now with the dominance of short
        form video content such as Tiktok or reels. Although allowing the flow of information to be greater, it reduces
        it to being comparable to almost a fraction of a second in the grand scheme of things. This makes it harder for
        people to really engage with such content. Although it may seem as though digital literacy is decreasing, text
        heavy content such as online books and choice games still align with Moulthrop’s idea of a digital typographic
        culture reemerging.</p>



    <p>While the internet has amplified hypertext’s ability to connect users, it has been turned into a tool for the
        capitalist system where its used for profit rather than for a cultural revolution</p>
