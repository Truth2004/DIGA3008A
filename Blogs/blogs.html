    Week 1- Blog Post

<p>   My experience of setting up GitHub and publishing to pages was pretty nerve racking. To me telling myself it was going to be easy vs how I had an issue that was easily fixed by me simply making a letter lowercase instead of uppercase, it reminded me just how finicky the course is. I guess I needed the reminder as I may have been getting complacent.</p> 

<p>A reading that stuck out to me was “Library of Babel” by Borges. It envisions a library with all the worlds knowledge, going as far as there apparently being a book just for this in the labyrinth known as the Library of Babel. It stuck out to me because it highlighted how there’s going to be a point where there’s so much knowledge that we won’t know what to do with. Relating to today’s internet, we have so many things coming in daily that we can’t even tell apart what’s true and what’s not. What’s considered old knowledge and what’s updated. It speaks of a dystopia of a world of interconnected text and a never-ending stream of information. This is something that’s prominent of today’s time. However, it does have its plus sides. We hold devices that allow us to look up a wide array of knowledge with just our finger tips. Funny enough, the imagined Library of Babel sits in our pockets. Knowledge is sorted and categorized for us to sift through.</p>

<p>An interesting thing I found on the history of the web is how initially, it was designed for scientists to share information easily across institutions as a tool for high energy physics. I found it interesting because back then it was something unheard of and advanced. However, by today’s standards, it’s the norm as much as it is seeing a child operating such as system. I also found it interesting how long before the web was even created, people who didn't have access to it or even know of its future creation were already making their own version of it (Library of Babel).</p>

<p>My goals for the end of this course are to have grasped what has been taught to me and somewhat be efficient enough to explain why I do what I do. Getting a hang of the basics is crucial to the future years to come as it steers my life in the direction, I have planned for myself. My goals are mainly to work hard and do my upmost best to catch onto the course work as best as I can.</p>
