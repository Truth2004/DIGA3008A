    <h2>Week 1- Blog Post</h2>

<p>   My experience of setting up GitHub and publishing to pages was pretty nerve racking. To me telling myself it was going to be easy vs how I had an issue that was easily fixed by me simply making a letter lowercase instead of uppercase, it reminded me just how finicky the course is. I guess I needed the reminder as I may have been getting complacent.</p> 

<p>A reading that stuck out to me was “Library of Babel” by Borges. It envisions a library with all the worlds knowledge, going as far as there apparently being a book just for this in the labyrinth known as the Library of Babel. It stuck out to me because it highlighted how there’s going to be a point where there’s so much knowledge that we won’t know what to do with. Relating to today’s internet, we have so many things coming in daily that we can’t even tell apart what’s true and what’s not. What’s considered old knowledge and what’s updated. It speaks of a dystopia of a world of interconnected text and a never-ending stream of information. This is something that’s prominent of today’s time. However, it does have its plus sides. We hold devices that allow us to look up a wide array of knowledge with just our finger tips. Funny enough, the imagined Library of Babel sits in our pockets. Knowledge is sorted and categorized for us to sift through.</p>

<p>An interesting thing I found on the history of the web is how initially, it was designed for scientists to share information easily across institutions as a tool for high energy physics. I found it interesting because back then it was something unheard of and advanced. However, by today’s standards, it’s the norm as much as it is seeing a child operating such as system. I also found it interesting how long before the web was even created, people who didn't have access to it or even know of its future creation were already making their own version of it (Library of Babel).</p>

<p>My goals for the end of this course are to have grasped what has been taught to me and somewhat be efficient enough to explain why I do what I do. Getting a hang of the basics is crucial to the future years to come as it steers my life in the direction, I have planned for myself. My goals are mainly to work hard and do my upmost best to catch onto the course work as best as I can.</p>

<h2>Week 2- Blog Post</h2>

<p>In terms of the internet of today, Moulthrop’s warnings regarding corporate control has grown even more evident. Major tech companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, and X control the internet, influencing the ways in which information is retrieved and utilized. Rather than being the decentralized and democratic environment envisioned by early internet pioneers, the web has turned into a highly centralized platform, with algorithms dictating user visibility, much like how early hypertext got incorporated into established corporate media frameworks. Platforms currently emphasize profit over free exploration, with the monetization of user data serving as a significant motivator. Moulthrop’s concern about hypertext devolving into a standardized, corporate dominated medium has arguably materialized.</p>

 

<p>However, its not all bad. Today’s internet still lives up to Moulthrop’s expectations when it comes to his ideas of hypertext enhancing pattern recognition and connectivity. Websites like Reddit allow users to throw ideas amongst themselves and help each other be more knowledgeable. At times this causes knowledge overload as too much knowledge may be shared and not enough is digested. This leads me to also include how Moulthrop’s observation that hypertext challenges traditional literacy is even more relevant now with the dominance of short form video content such as Tiktok or reels. Although allowing the flow of information to be greater, it reduces it to being comparable to almost a fraction of a second in the grand scheme of things. This makes it harder for people to really engage with such content. Although it may seem as though digital literacy is decreasing, text heavy content such as online books and choice games still align with Moulthrop’s idea of a digital typographic culture reemerging.</p>

 

<p>While the internet has amplified hypertext’s ability to connect users, it has been turned into a tool for the capitalist system where its used for profit rather than for a cultural revolution</p>
