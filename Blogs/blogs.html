    <h2>Week 1- Blog Post</h2>

    <p> My experience of setting up GitHub and publishing to pages was pretty nerve racking. To me telling myself it was
        going to be easy vs how I had an issue that was easily fixed by me simply making a letter lowercase instead of
        uppercase, it reminded me just how finicky the course is. I guess I needed the reminder as I may have been
        getting complacent.</p>

    <p>A reading that stuck out to me was “Library of Babel” by Borges. It envisions a library with all the worlds
        knowledge, going as far as there apparently being a book just for this in the labyrinth known as the Library of
        Babel. It stuck out to me because it highlighted how there’s going to be a point where there’s so much knowledge
        that we won’t know what to do with. Relating to today’s internet, we have so many things coming in daily that we
        can’t even tell apart what’s true and what’s not. What’s considered old knowledge and what’s updated. It speaks
        of a dystopia of a world of interconnected text and a never-ending stream of information. This is something
        that’s prominent of today’s time. However, it does have its plus sides. We hold devices that allow us to look up
        a wide array of knowledge with just our finger tips. Funny enough, the imagined Library of Babel sits in our
        pockets. Knowledge is sorted and categorized for us to sift through.</p>

    <p>An interesting thing I found on the history of the web is how initially, it was designed for scientists to share
        information easily across institutions as a tool for high energy physics. I found it interesting because back
        then it was something unheard of and advanced. However, by today’s standards, it’s the norm as much as it is
        seeing a child operating such as system. I also found it interesting how long before the web was even created,
        people who didn't have access to it or even know of its future creation were already making their own version of
        it (Library of Babel).</p>

    <p>My goals for the end of this course are to have grasped what has been taught to me and somewhat be efficient
        enough to explain why I do what I do. Getting a hang of the basics is crucial to the future years to come as it
        steers my life in the direction, I have planned for myself. My goals are mainly to work hard and do my upmost
        best to catch onto the course work as best as I can.</p>

    <h2>Week 2- Blog Post</h2>

    <p>In terms of the internet of today, Moulthrop’s warnings regarding corporate control has grown even more evident.
        Major tech companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, and X control the internet, influencing the ways in which
        information is retrieved and utilized. Rather than being the decentralized and democratic environment envisioned
        by early internet pioneers, the web has turned into a highly centralized platform, with algorithms dictating
        user visibility, much like how early hypertext got incorporated into established corporate media frameworks.
        Platforms currently emphasize profit over free exploration, with the monetization of user data serving as a
        significant motivator. Moulthrop’s concern about hypertext devolving into a standardized, corporate dominated
        medium has arguably materialized.</p>



    <p>However, its not all bad. Today’s internet still lives up to Moulthrop’s expectations when it comes to his ideas
        of hypertext enhancing pattern recognition and connectivity. Websites like Reddit allow users to throw ideas
        amongst themselves and help each other be more knowledgeable. At times this causes knowledge overload as too
        much knowledge may be shared and not enough is digested. This leads me to also include how Moulthrop’s
        observation that hypertext challenges traditional literacy is even more relevant now with the dominance of short
        form video content such as Tiktok or reels. Although allowing the flow of information to be greater, it reduces
        it to being comparable to almost a fraction of a second in the grand scheme of things. This makes it harder for
        people to really engage with such content. Although it may seem as though digital literacy is decreasing, text
        heavy content such as online books and choice games still align with Moulthrop’s idea of a digital typographic
        culture reemerging.</p>



    <p>While the internet has amplified hypertext’s ability to connect users, it has been turned into a tool for the
        capitalist system where its used for profit rather than for a cultural revolution</p>

    <h2>Week 3-Blog Post</h2>

    <p>My site is specifically to showcase my works to potential employers, collaborators and recruiters who want to see
        my digital art projects. These projects include Game Designs, game developments and art. My site needs to
        clearly/easily show my projects in a way that gives viewers an idea of my skill and experience. It needs to have
        easy navigation. The customization of the website should also have a unique aesthetic that showcases my
        personality a bit, so it feels a bit more personal when viewers are going through my website.</p>



    <h3>Content mapping</h3>

    Homepage – Introduction and featured works

    Game Dev page – Showcase of games I’ve worked on/ developed, mechanics and technical breakdowns

    Gallery page- Visual showcase of art, animations, or UI work

    Blogs page- A collection of weekly blogs and reflections

    Essays page- A collection of essays

    Web Design page- Showcases the development of my website and how it came to be

    About- How to contact me, includes my list of accounts and information about me.



    <h3>Experience Mapping</h3>

    Land on the Homepage, see the introduction to learn a bit about me, see featured projects, then explore the other
    pages through the navigation, end up in About pages to contact me or learn more about me. Able to check the homepage
    for updates for any returning visitors.

    The plan is to progressively improve my visual hierarchy, make updates easy to find, and make a better structure to
    show my work and skill easier.



    <h3>Interface elements</h3>

    Easy to see navigation bar – Quick access to key sections

    Project cards – Clickable thumbnails with brief descriptions



    <h3>URL Scheme and Sematic Markup</h3>

    <p>My website makes use of a simple structured URL scheme;</p>

    html (Homepage)
    Game Dev/gamedev.html (Game Dev page)
    Galley/gallery.html (Gallery page)
    Blogs/blogs.html (Blogs page)
    Essays/essays.html (Essays page)
    Web Design/web design.html (Web Design page)
    About/about.html (About me page)


    <p>Each page will be built with semantic HTML;</p>

    <header> for site navigation
        <main> for core content
            <section> for grouping related elements
                <article> for individual projects
                    <footer> for additional links and contact details
                        This makes accessibility and maintainability easier.



                        <h3>Weekly Development reflection</h3>

                        <p>This week I focused on designing my websites layout and ensuring that the navigation works
                            between each page. I’m feeling confident about future updates in ensuring I create a smooth
                            user experience. I plan on implementing my art into the overall design of my website to
                            create a more interactive experience and hopefully give my a site a unique aesthetic.</p>

                        <h2>Week 4-Blog Post</h2>

                        <h3>Interaction Design Process</h3>

                        <p>My site is specifically to showcase my works to potential employers, collaborators and
                            recruiters who want to see my digital art projects. These projects include Game Designs,
                            game developments and art. My site needs to clearly/easily show my projects in a way that
                            gives viewers an idea of my skill and experience. It needs to have easy navigation. The
                            customization of the website should also have a unique aesthetic that showcases my
                            personality a bit, so it feels a bit more personal when viewers are going through my
                            website.</p>

                        <p>I’m going to try work on at least a single interactive element a week (like hover effects or
                            expandable thumbnail sections). As well as taking into consideration what my website will
                            look like on different platforms. Besides working on the actual content of the website, I’ll
                            just be continuing to build it up bit by bit.</p>

                        <h3>Website 1 Reflection</h3>

                        <h4>Struggles:</h4>

                        <p>Main thing I’m trying to focus on is making sure my website looks good and is a good
                            representation of myself. Having a balance of visuals to text is currently what I’m working
                            on first because I feel it would be easier to make a decent looking website for my first
                            iterations over a good one. However, I don’t want to make it too text heavy, but that also
                            risks making it seem empty.</p>

                        <h4>Proud of:</h4>

                        <p>I’m proud of my idea of incorporating my game dev into the actual design of the website.
                            Although it won’t be easy, I’m looking forward to my process of putting everything together.
                            I’m also really proud of my progress so far in terms of understanding how to code a website.
                            Its still early but I’m confident it’s only going to get better from here.</p>

                        <h4>Going Forward:</h4>

                        <p>Going forward I’d like to focus more on my actual design process and making it more
                            structured. Right no it feels like I’m doing everything in bits and pieces which doesn’t
                            feel pleasant for workflow on my end.</p>

                        <p>I’m going to work a bit more on adding the base of my website and make it as consistent as
                            possible throughout all the pages.</p>

                        <p>Lastly, I’m going to do more research on interactive elements to help make my website feel
                            livelier.</p>
