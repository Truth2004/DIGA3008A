    <p>My site is specifically to showcase my works to potential employers, collaborators and recruiters who want to see
        my digital art projects. These projects include Game Designs, game developments and art. My site needs to
        clearly/easily show my projects in a way that gives viewers an idea of my skill and experience. It needs to have
        easy navigation. The customization of the website should also have a unique aesthetic that showcases my
        personality a bit, so it feels a bit more personal when viewers are going through my website.</p>



    <h3>Content mapping</h3>

    Homepage – Introduction and featured works

    Game Dev page – Showcase of games I’ve worked on/ developed, mechanics and technical breakdowns

    Gallery page- Visual showcase of art, animations, or UI work

    Blogs page- A collection of weekly blogs and reflections

    Essays page- A collection of essays

    Web Design page- Showcases the development of my website and how it came to be

    About- How to contact me, includes my list of accounts and information about me.



    <h3>Experience Mapping</h3>

    Land on the Homepage, see the introduction to learn a bit about me, see featured projects, then explore the other
    pages through the navigation, end up in About pages to contact me or learn more about me. Able to check the homepage
    for updates for any returning visitors.

    The plan is to progressively improve my visual hierarchy, make updates easy to find, and make a better structure to
    show my work and skill easier.



    <h3>Interface elements</h3>

    Easy to see navigation bar – Quick access to key sections

    Project cards – Clickable thumbnails with brief descriptions



    <h3>URL Scheme and Sematic Markup</h3>

    <p>My website makes use of a simple structured URL scheme;</p>

    html (Homepage)
    Game Dev/gamedev.html (Game Dev page)
    Galley/gallery.html (Gallery page)
    Blogs/blogs.html (Blogs page)
    Essays/essays.html (Essays page)
    Web Design/web design.html (Web Design page)
    About/about.html (About me page)


    <p>Each page will be built with semantic HTML;</p>

    <header> for site navigation
        <main> for core content
            <section> for grouping related elements
                <article> for individual projects
                    <footer> for additional links and contact details
                        This makes accessibility and maintainability easier.



                        <h3>Weekly Development reflection</h3>

                        <p>This week I focused on designing my websites layout and ensuring that the navigation works
                            between each page. I’m feeling confident about future updates in ensuring I create a smooth
                            user experience. I plan on implementing my art into the overall design of my website to
                            create a more interactive experience and hopefully give my a site a unique aesthetic.</p>
