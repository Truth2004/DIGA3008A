                            <h2>Design inspiration</h2>
                            <p>I’ve taken inspiration from Aaminah Habibs website as it stood out to me. She makes use
                                of a
                                minimalistic modern design that prioritizes her content, which also aligns with the goal
                                I
                                set out for myself. Her colour pallet leans to the neutral end and does amazingly in
                                keeping
                                her website appearing balanced. There is consistency throughout her site which I aim to
                                replicate in my own way. This is seen in the page layouts, colour and nav bar
                                positioning.
                                She makes use of a sticky nav bar on each page which really stood out to me as it makes
                                navigating her website an absolute breeze. I’m considering employing this method in a
                                future
                                iteration to increase my user-friendly experience as I think it would make a wonderful
                                addition. It keeps the design unified while making sure users always have access to
                                important sections of the website.</p>

                            <h2>Style Guide</h2>
                            Statement: My website will showcase a minimalistic aesthetic prioritizing user friendliness,
                            in highlighting my skills in interactive media and Game design. <br>

                            <h3>Visual aesthetic</h3>
                            My websites aesthetic is leaning towards being minimalistic and modern. This ensures a sleek
                            design while also making sure that it’s not overwhelming for the viewer. My design focuses
                            on displaying my Interactive media and game design content so it shouldn’t be fighting for
                            the attention of the person viewing the website, drawing it away from the actual work.
                            Having a minimalistic design also ensures that viewers can navigate their way through each
                            page without feeling lost.

                            <h3>Colour scheme</h3>

                            Black and white ensures readability and clarity to viewers. This colour matchup works well
                            with a minimalistic interface because simplicity and functionality are prioritized. In
                            colour theory we say that they are achromatic, meaning they lack hue and saturation. This
                            ensures that my website looks balanced. It removes distractions while making the content and
                            layout of the site stand out. <br>

                            <h3>Layout</h3>

                            The layout of the website will focus on the prioritization of content, so it’ll make use of
                            a grid structure ensuring a well organized and visually balanced look. Having generous
                            amounts of black and white space will improve the readability and focus of the viewer while
                            reducing clutter. Each page is going to have a nav bar at the top and a button on either the
                            bottom left or right that lets them skip back to the top without having to scroll. <br>

                            My homepage is going to give a short introduction welcoming users to my site and stating who
                            I am, with a little picture just below the Navigation bar, at the centre of the page. This
                            helps to make the users experience feel a bit more personal. The user will then be able to
                            scroll down and see a “featured projects” section of project cards with thumbnails and a
                            short description on them giving them a bit of an idea of what they are looking at. <br>

                            The gallery page is going to showcase any art I’ve worked on. These works will be displayed
                            using a hierarchical grid structure to keep the page looking organized. Clicking on an image
                            will make it upsize so users can take a closer look. The grid itself will be made of squares
                            and rectangles placed next to each other in a random manner. This is to allow the eye to
                            wonder around the page as they try look for balance. <br>

                            My blogs page will make use of the same thumbnail cards as the featured projects section on
                            my homepage, Each card will have a snippet of what you can read, while clicking on “read
                            more” will bring up the contents. These cards will also have visuals, so viewers get quick
                            insight encouraging them to read up further. <br>

                            The Game dev page will make use of the same structure as the blogs page, with thumbnail
                            cards. <br>

                            <h3>Interface Element Representations</h3>

                            <h4>Navigation Bar</h4>

                            The use of this element on each page allows the user to easily move back and forth between
                            the pages while also being notified what page they’re on. The nav bar fitting the
                            minimalistic theme also aids in a user-friendly interface. <br>

                            <h4>Buttons</h4>

                            Buttons enable the user to interact with the websites interface. They are just going to be
                            clickable text with a potential animation put in or hover state to show that you’re over it
                            with your mouse cursor. <br>
